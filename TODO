- charts/hub/ocp-install/charts/issuer/templates/setup.yaml needs to be rewritten into an ansible cronjob

It needs to loop over each imported cluster in ACM and configure the corresponding vault backend accordingly

- Drop last lookup() calls in:
charts/hub/ocp-install/charts/issuer/templates/issuer.yaml
charts/hub/ocp-install/charts/influxdb2/templates/secret.yaml

- Move to external secrets for the sasl configuration
charts/region/sno-srv-install/values.yaml
charts/hub/ocp-srv-install/values.yaml

- Move to vault + ES for factory
Factory is still using hardcoded passwords in values.yaml, move to ES for all of them

- Define the best way to push down the following onto a factory:
  coreservice.serial=<<YOUR_FACTORY_SERIAL>>,coreservice.name=<<YOUR_FACTORY_NAME>>

My suspicion is that the best approach is to just add tags/metadata to the ACM node and then
somehow leverage that on the node itself

- Drop the ansible-job copying service-cert.ca from configmap to secret for cert-manager if https://github.com/openshift/service-ca-operator/pull/205 or something similar ever gets merged
