- charts/hub/ocp-install/charts/issuer/templates/setup.yaml needs to be rewritten into an ansible cronjob

It needs to loop over each imported cluster in ACM and configure the corresponding vault backend accordingly

- Drop last lookup() calls in:
charts/hub/ocp-install/charts/issuer/templates/issuer.yaml
charts/hub/ocp-install/charts/influxdb2/templates/secret.yaml

- Move to external secrets for the sasl configuration
charts/region/sno-srv-install/values.yaml
charts/hub/ocp-srv-install/values.yaml

- Move to vault + ES for factory
Factory is still using hardcoded passwords in values.yaml, move to ES for all of them
